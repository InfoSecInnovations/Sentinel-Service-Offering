# ARM Templates

We have made good use of the templates from https://github.com/OTRF/Microsoft-Sentinel2Go and https://github.com/OTRF/Blacksmith to create our own configuration. The default template is a modified version of https://github.com/OTRF/Blacksmith/blob/master/templates/azure/Log-Analytics-Workspace-Sentinel/demos/LA-Sentinel-Windows-Settings.json

The workbook templates can be downloaded from the web UI after setting them up manually. Currently they have been pasted into the main template as we don't yet support linking private templates.
