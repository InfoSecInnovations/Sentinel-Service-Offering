# InfoSec Innovations Sentinel Service Offering

We are building a library of useful templates to set up Microsoft Sentinel resources using ARM templates.

We have made use of https://github.com/OTRF/Blacksmith and https://github.com/OTRF/Microsoft-Sentinel2Go/ to find existing templates for some of the elements we wish to deploy. Some of our templates are modified versions of these, or in some cases we have even directly linked them because they do what we need.

InfoSec Innovations does not bear responsibility for the consequences of using this repository, the files have mostly been made public for our own convenience, but you are free to use them at your own risk.
